This is also during the time of the National Day holiday, so I thought it would be perfect for a Washington D.C trip. National ParkImportant: Closure on July 4th due to firework, that includes everything west of 17th st, which includes the Lincoln Memorial and Reflecting Pool; The Washington Monument, being the center-piece of the firework is also closed down. However, visiting on July 3rd or 5th is a great alternative. You can easily spend half a day in a single museum, especially if you’re with kids. For the larger and more famous museums, two hours is generally sufficient, and for other sites, half to one hour. Here’s an example route from my experience: National Museum of Natural History (2 hr) National Gallery of Art (1 hr) National Air and Space Museum (1 hr) United States Botanic Garden (0.5 hr) Smithsonian Castle (0.5 hr) The White House (0.5 hr) The Ellipse Washington Monument (1 hr) World War II Memorial and Reflecting Pool (1 hr) Lincoln Memorial (1 hr) Korean War Veterans Memorial During my visit on July 4th, I could only catch a glimpse of Capitol Hill, the Smithsonian Castle, and the White House, primarily due to Covid restrictions that had temporarily closed down all the museums. It was a bit disappointing, to say the least. As I mentioned, you could easily spend more time at each museum, and there are many others within the National Park and the surrounding streets. FireworkFor watching the fireworks, there are plenty of spots to sit; just make sure to arrive 30 minutes in advance and do it on foot. Expect large crowds and some traffic congestion. The fireworks display lasts around 10-15 minutes, which can be a bit underwhelming, especially if you’re expecting music accompaniment like at Disneyland. ChinatownChinatown is within a 15-minute walk from the National Park and is accessible via D.C.’s metro system. It’s not only a great dining district but also home to several nearby hotels. I stayed at the Fairfield Inn, just across the street from Chinatown. However, I wouldn’t recommend this hotel as it feels a bit dated. BaltimoreBaltimore, home to the famous Johns Hopkins University, is just an hour’s drive away from Washington, D.C. I’d recommend a short visit during the National Park’s closure. Baltimore is generally clean and safe during the day, and I particularly enjoyed the dockside area. There are also plenty of parking garages available. Thames Street Oyster HouseAfter strolling around downtown and the dock region, we had an amazing dining experience at the Thames Street Oyster House, where we indulged in a variety of delicious raw oyster selections. Leesburg Premium OutletsAnother option to fill your day is a visit to the Leesburg Premium Outlets, which is also about an hour away from D.C. Here, you’ll find all the popular brands you’d expect from an outlet store, including Armani and Burberry. Your support keeps our adventures alive.

The beautiful lakeside city of Michigan City is only a 1.5-hour drive away from Purdue University in West Lafayette, home of the Boilermakers. For someone like me living in the east of the nation, it is the closest I can get for a costal ocean and beach experience, and for almost no costs! Which is why throughout the years I spent living in the northern east, I’ve visited Michigan city three times. Indiana Dunes State ParkImportant: Don’t get mixed with “Indiana Dunes National Park”, which will get discussed at the very end. Let’s get straight to the point, look at those beaches and water, there’s no distinction between this great lake and the actual ocean visually. The swimming beach is located inside the Indiana Dunes State Park, spreading over 2000 acres. What’s more, the state park also offers over 16 miles of hiking trails. So, you can go for a short hike and then dive in and cool down at the gorgeous Michigan great lake. The entry fee is only $7 per vehicle for Indiana residents and $12 per vehicle for non-residents. Like all other state parks, there are certain days when the entry fees are free. Other StopsShoreline Brewery &amp; Restaurant If you need to grab a bite, I strongly recommend this place as I’ve happened to visit them twice, and both experience were fantastic. They have excellent crafted beers and also amazing fish and chips. The restaurant is also super close to the premium outlets and also the lighthouse next to the lake coast. Michigan Pierhead Lighthouse This landmark stands proudly at the edge of Lake Michigan.The beach next to the lighthouse has hard sand compared to the state park. However, the advantage is that it offers a pretty spectacular view and, the best part, you can enjoy this stunning vista without spending a dime. Lighthouse Place Premium Outlets The Lighthouse Premium Outlets are also a point of interest, with ample parking space and a wide variety of dining options. As you shop, you can enjoy the open-air experience and breathe in the fresh lakeside air. Indiana Dunes National Park (Optional) The Indian Dunes National Park is located on the both sides of the State Park, it is perfect for camping if you need plans for multiple days. The entry fee is $25 per vehicle for a 7-day pass. Your support keeps our adventures alive.

Situated right between two major Missouri cities, Kansas City and St. Louis, Columbia is a hidden gem that I recommend to anyone traveling through I-70; Stroll at MizzouThe centerpiece of our visit is the campus tour of the University of Missouri - Columbia (Mizzou). I advise setting aside at least 2 hours to explore the main part of the campus.Some must-see spots, in my opinion, include the iconic six columns (alongside Jesse Hall in the same plaza), the Memorial Union, Ellis Library, the Tiger fountain and the Student Center (with the Rec Center conveniently just across the street).For your ease, I’ve outlined an optimal walking route to cover all these interesting points efficiently as I’ve been tour guiding friends and families multiple times. (Route start at Lee Hills Hall) Exploring Campus BuildingsMany of the campus buildings are open to the public. Don’t miss out on visiting the Engineering Building (which was newly built), Jesse Hall, Ellis Library, Memorial Union, and the Student Center. The campus bookstore is also in the Student Center if you wish to purchase Mizzou souvenirs. Mizzou Rec’s Guest ServicesIf you happen to know someone studying in Mizzou, I highly recommend visiting the Mizzou Rec for a reasonable fee of $12 (including tax). In addition to the gym facilities, they offer a spa for some relaxation. Did I mention, it was once voted as top 3 best recreational center in the nation. Learn more here: Mizzou Rec Guest Services Downtown DelightsColumbia’s downtown area offers a range of delightful options. I often go to the boba shop: Bubblecup Tea Zone, Thai restaurants (Thai Express and Bangkok Gardens are my top picks), and much more to satisfy any taste buds for lunch or dinner after the campus tour The Big Burr OakColumbia’s hidden gem, in my opinion, is the Big burr oak tree. It’s definitely worth a short 10-mile trip, taking less than 20 minutes to drive. The journey is peaceful and the destination is Instagram-worthy shot of a huge Oak tree with the perfect tree crown. Other StopsStephens Lake Park:If you’re looking for a place to unwind after your tour or road trip, I recommend Stephens Lake Park. Although not vast, it features a charming small lake with walking bridges (often bustling with people fishing). It’s a picnic-friendly spot and even welcomes your furry friends. Capen Park:Capen Park is perfect for you if you’d like to get some outdoor trail walking going where you can experience some small elevation with beautiful cliffs. It’s only 5 minutes drive away from Mizzou Campus. The Grindstone Creek (which you’ll be able to overlook) is also accessible on foot. Columbia Mall:For some generic retail stores beyond the downtown area, a visit to the Columbia Mall is a good choice. Jefferson City:The Capital of Missouri, Jefferson City is about a 50 minutes drive from Columbia towards the south, so it’s not in the same direction between Kansas City and St Louis.There’s a pretty good Sushi place called love sushi, they are in good value (the sexy lady and sexy guy are brought with fire lit). Other than the State Capitol Hall and the Missouri State Museum there’s not much to visit. Your support keeps our adventures alive.
