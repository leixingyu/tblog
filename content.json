It’s one of those places where you wish you could stay forever, but for now, let’s dive into a day trip that had us captivated from sunrise to sunset. Sunrise, We’re Ready for You The day kicked off early as we raced to the Sunrise Visitor Center. We’d heard this was the prime spot to witness a sunrise over Mount Rainier, and we weren’t disappointed. With our cameras at the ready, we soaked in the moment when the sun’s first rays kissed the mountain’s peak. Hiking with a Side of Wildflowers After the sunrise spectacle, we laced up our hiking boots and hit the Wonderland Trail. This is where you’ll find wildflowers that can brighten even the grumpiest hiker’s day, especially during the summer. The trail took us through meadows where we met chirping birds, curious marmots, and even a black-tailed deer or two. A Picnic with Panache We worked up quite the appetite, and our gourmet picnic was an absolute treat. Fresh air and good food? That’s a combo that’s tough to beat. We relished bites of artisanal cheese and ripe fruit while soaking in the serene surroundings. Chasing Waterfalls and Feeling Cool In the afternoon, we found ourselves chasing waterfalls — Christine Falls and Narada Falls, to be exact. The cool mist and the roar of the falls were a refreshing break from our hiking. Sunset Magic at Reflection Lakes The day drew to a close at Reflection Lakes, where we were treated to a mesmerizing sunset. Watching the mountain’s reflection in the calm waters was like the grand finale of a spectacular show. Heading Back Home As we left, we couldn’t help but make a promise to return. A day at Mount Rainier is just a taste of the magic this place holds.
