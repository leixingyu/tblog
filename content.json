I boarded the “Dolphin,” hopeful that we might spot dolphins or even whales during our journey Since I know there’s some trips on the coast that offers this. I was wrong because I only get to see a lot of seagulls… Sundays offer a special treat where one adult can bring a child on board for free. This day, the boat was bustling with children excited to cast their lines. Many seasoned fishermen joined us, their confidence and knowledge slightly intimidating for a first-timer like me. Check-In and PreparationsThe check-in process at the office was hassle-free. We obtained fishing licenses and rented our gear from the counter, with ample parking nearby. The boat’s boarding process was efficient, and the staff assisted in assigning bags for storing our catches. It’s cost-effective to share a bag with a partner, as each bag costs $2, and there’s a $3 raffle for the person who lands the largest fish. Setting Sail and BaitingShortly after departure, the crew prepared live fish from the onboard tank for use as bait, alongside other options like squid strips. After an hour at sea, we received a briefings on how to fish: we were to drop the hook, attached to a heavy anchor, down to the ocean floor, then raise it slightly above the seabed. This is where the fish congregate to bite, and we were advised that the area behind the boat experiences less turbulence. Fishing BeginsAfter about 1.5 hours, the boat finally anchored, and everyone was eager to cast their lines. No specific spots were assigned; people could choose any available space. Learning to operate the fishing equipment took a couple of tries, but the real challenge was sensing the bites with the boat’s constant movement. I caught my first mackerel in under 10 minutes, followed by another. However, we started to feel queasy (even though we had taken motion sickness pills). We were far from the coast, with moderate waves, and the temperature dropped considerably, shifting from sunny to windy. The cold wind, turbulence, and motion sickness made it hard to keep fishing. I took a break and headed to the restroom to throw up. Feeling better, I resumed fishing and caught my first sculpin, a peculiar-looking, venomous fish (they had to remove its spines before unhooking it). Unfortunately, I fell ill once more and vomited again. Time passed quickly, but due to the time I spent resting, I estimated about 1.5 hours of actual fishing. The boat repositioned once mid-way. Those prone to motion sickness likely had even less fishing time. The boat started heading back around 5:30 PM, and the temperature continued to drop with the wind becoming harsh. I was weak, feeling the effects of throwing up and missing my dinner routine. The journey back left me cold and miserable. In the end, the crew helped clean and fillet our catch: we had 5 mackerels and 2 sculpins. We cooked them, but they didn’t taste different from store-bought fish. Overall, the experience was quite expensive at $300 for just a couple of fish. Despite my motion sickness, I believe we would have enjoyed it more without it. A few other first-timers also struggled with seasickness, so it’s something to keep in mind. Overall, it was a unique experience, but I gave it a one-star rating due to the physical discomfort I endured. Your support keeps our adventures alive.

Downtown Cleveland left a good impression—clean and safe. Upon entering The Arcade, the classical interior design immediately captivates attention. Although meant to be a hotel and indoor mini-mall, there aren’t many people around—just a few tourists taking pictures, cleaning staff preparing for an evening event, and a couple of youngsters enjoying coffee. There’s no access to the upper level (hotel rooms), and most stores are closed. However, we explored the main level, both front and back, capturing gorgeous, Instagram-worthy photos. Downtown WalkWith 2 hours of free parking and many nearby attractions, we opted for a walking tour of downtown Cleveland. Our planned route covered several sites in a half-hour walk, allowing us to stop anytime and return. The walk concluded at the pier overlooking Lake Erie. The Mall Walking through downtown provides an authentic city experience, showcasing road and grass maintenance, traffic planning, and landmarks adding essence to a city’s soul. Cleveland’s downtown is refreshing, featuring the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial, Fountain of Eternal Liberty, The Mall’s meadow, City Hall, Willard Park, and, a bit further, Cleveland’s pier by Lake Erie. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: “Rock Hall” The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a must-visit for enthusiasts, offering a comprehensive history of rock and roll for $35. Casual passersby can enjoy free live rock and roll shows in the plaza throughout the day. USS COD Submarine Memorial Across from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the USS COD Submarine Memorial, a historic submarine turned museum, charges $14 for adults and $8 for K-12 students. Though gated and limiting photo opportunities, the limited time and perceived value deterred us from paying. Other AttractionsWest Side Market For a quick bite while shopping for local goods and street foods, West Side Market is a metropolitan market providing just that. Greater Cleveland Aquarium Having visited on March 13, 2019, my expectations for the Greater Cleveland Aquarium were high due to its proximity to Lake Erie. Unfortunately, I found this small aquarium lacking. Priced at $20, it’s not worth the trip for adults unless you have kids. Cuyahoga Valley National Park: Beaver MarshFinally, don’t miss a chance to relax in nature at the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, offering free admission. I recommend the Ira Trail, an easy trail passing the famous Beaver Marsh. Well-maintained, close to the entrance and parking, with no elevation, it provides direct access to a marsh, home to beavers. If you’re lucky, as I was, you might catch a glimpse of a beaver. One of them swam so fast beneath the water that I barely captured its shape. Additionally, ducks, regular turtles, and even snapping turtles the size of a basketball are quite common. Your support keeps our adventures alive.

This is also during the time of the National Day holiday, so I thought it would be perfect for a Washington D.C trip. National ParkImportant: Closure on July 4th due to firework, that includes everything west of 17th st, which includes the Lincoln Memorial and Reflecting Pool; The Washington Monument, being the center-piece of the firework is also closed down. However, visiting on July 3rd or 5th is a great alternative. You can easily spend half a day in a single museum, especially if you’re with kids. For the larger and more famous museums, two hours is generally sufficient, and for other sites, half to one hour. Here’s an example route from my experience: National Museum of Natural History (2 hr) National Gallery of Art (1 hr) National Air and Space Museum (1 hr) United States Botanic Garden (0.5 hr) Smithsonian Castle (0.5 hr) The White House (0.5 hr) The Ellipse Washington Monument (1 hr) World War II Memorial and Reflecting Pool (1 hr) Lincoln Memorial (1 hr) Korean War Veterans Memorial During my visit on July 4th, I could only catch a glimpse of Capitol Hill, the Smithsonian Castle, and the White House, primarily due to Covid restrictions that had temporarily closed down all the museums. It was a bit disappointing, to say the least. As I mentioned, you could easily spend more time at each museum, and there are many others within the National Park and the surrounding streets. FireworkFor watching the fireworks, there are plenty of spots to sit; just make sure to arrive 30 minutes in advance and do it on foot. Expect large crowds and some traffic congestion. The fireworks display lasts around 10-15 minutes, which can be a bit underwhelming, especially if you’re expecting music accompaniment like at Disneyland. ChinatownChinatown is within a 15-minute walk from the National Park and is accessible via D.C.’s metro system. It’s not only a great dining district but also home to several nearby hotels. I stayed at the Fairfield Inn, just across the street from Chinatown. However, I wouldn’t recommend this hotel as it feels a bit dated. BaltimoreBaltimore, home to the famous Johns Hopkins University, is just an hour’s drive away from Washington, D.C. I’d recommend a short visit during the National Park’s closure. Baltimore is generally clean and safe during the day, and I particularly enjoyed the dockside area. There are also plenty of parking garages available. Thames Street Oyster HouseAfter strolling around downtown and the dock region, we had an amazing dining experience at the Thames Street Oyster House, where we indulged in a variety of delicious raw oyster selections. Leesburg Premium OutletsAnother option to fill your day is a visit to the Leesburg Premium Outlets, which is also about an hour away from D.C. Here, you’ll find all the popular brands you’d expect from an outlet store, including Armani and Burberry. Your support keeps our adventures alive.

It’s an ideal destination for a family day trip, offering a hassle-free and perfect nature getaway with serene landscapes of trees and water. Link to their official website. for event information, locations, and transportation details. Miller Ferry at Catawba IslandThe Catawba Island Ferry is the primary option to reach Put-in-Bay on the other side. It provides ample parking spots just outside the ticket booth. You can choose to board the ferry on foot or drive your car (although expect longer wait times for vehicles). The wait isn’t bad if you’re on foot since the ferry can carry a large number of passengers. Even if there’s a long line, don’t be discouraged. After a brief half-hour wait, we boarded the ferry, with passengers moving to the second floor. Watching them load vehicles was quite interesting, and we enjoyed the 20-minute breeze on the lake as the ferry sailed. Put-in-bayUpon arriving at the island, you have a convenient bus to take you to downtown Put-in-Bay. Alternatively, you can rent a golf cart. Unfortunately, there was limited availability for golf cart rentals near the ferry dock, so we opted to ride the bus to downtown. However, there are plenty of golf carts available in the downtown area. We had lunch at The Boardwalk, located right by the river near downtown. The food was decent, although a bit pricier than we would have expected from a little island. After lunch, we took a leisurely walk along Bayview Avenue (basically the downtown), exploring local shops and sweets. Golf Cart RentalWe initially thought all golf carts were rented out because people on the bus were checking for availability and finding none. However, simply walking around, we discovered more options to rent golf carts. We ended up renting one for $50 for 4 hours. There’s no advantage to reversing one unless you plan to drive from the ferry dock to downtown, which I feel is very unnecessary. Driving the golf cart was straightforward, but we soon realized it was missing a windshield. This made our drive a bit cooler, but it wasn’t a big deal. There’s very little regular vehicle traffic on the island, making it easy to navigate. With limited parking spots, golf carts are quite versatile and can be parked almost anywhere. Compared to bringing your own vehicle or renting a bike, golf carts are the superior choice. Perry’s Victory and International Peace MemorialOur first stop was Perry’s Victory and International Peace Memorial, a monument where you can spend around 30 minutes relaxing and enjoying the lakeside views. Driving the golf cart to the northeastern corner, we reached Scheeff East Point View. As mentioned earlier, the island has minimal traffic, allowing you to park and go wherever you like. Perry’s Cave Family Fun CenterThe main attraction on the Put-in-bay is Perry’s Cave Family Fun Center, it is a hub for different smaller attraction such as mini-golf, winery tour, cave tour, butterfly tour, and gemstone mining (and many more). During our limited time, we only visited a few attractions, but it’s an excellent place to spend half a day. Just be sure not to miss the last ferry back to the mainland, which departs at 5:00 PM. Tickets range from $9 to $12 each for different attractions depending on whether you purchased separately or as combo tickets (e.g., choose any 3 out of 5 attractions). Winery Tour Put-in-Bay boasts a winery that distributes its wines across the states. Enjoy a tour of the winery, covering the entire winemaking process from grape to bottle in just 30 minutes. You also get to learn different kinds of wines and have a final tasting after the tour. It was a pretty refreshing Crystal Cave The crystal cave (Perry’s Cave) is the main attraction where you get to go 50 feet underground to explore the cave that is hallowed out from a single crystal geode, an impressive sight. I estimate it is around 800 square feet in sizes. The tour is self-guided, not a lot to see since it’s just one cave, but fair for its price. Butterfly House I don’t recommend the butterfly house, for $10 price you only get to spend at most 10 minutes as there are nothing really to see in this small and humid room. The variety of butterflies is limited, and it’s not very captivating. Unless you have children who are particularly fond of butterflies, spending time in the gift shop area should suffice.

Now that I am a grown-up, I can confidently say that the view of Niagara will certainly stick in my memory for the rest of my life because it was just so magnificent. The reason why we chose Niagara Falls is that we only planned to spend 3 days and 2 nights out. Niagara Falls is a single attraction with a 10-12 hour round trip, which is perfect. Also, the weather is starting to get cold, and we won’t have the option to visit anything in the north during the winter. Day 1We left Columbus, Ohio, freshly awake and energized early in the morning. Our plan was to have a short lunch halfway and then dinner at our destination: Niagara Falls. City ErieThe drive up north to Lake Erie was very familiar, as it is pretty much the same route to Cleveland. After passing Cleveland, just about half an hour away, we arrived at City Erie, located past the state border in Pennsylvania. After a quick bite, we stopped by at Presque Isle nearby, a clean and quiet island neighborhood. It looks very out of place to see many small houses floating on the lake. I am fascinated by this kind of living style. It must be super peaceful to roll a small kayak and dock right at your house’s front door. I also wonder how utilities work in a facility like this? The Channel Lighthouse is not far away, and many people living nearby take afternoon walks alongside the beautiful shoreline. Seagulls are basking in the warm sun at the foot of the lighthouse and then got startled as we walked in. All of them flew at the same time, which was quite a view, but I didn’t capture it. City NiagaraWe didn’t rest at all in the afternoon and continued our remaining 3-hour drive. We could already see the wide and strong river force of the Niagara River as we passed Buffalo, New York. We then could hear the Niagara Falls roaring and the water mist rising in the air just 10 minutes away from our destination. We also saw many rainbows. It was exhilarating, and all our tiredness from the long drive went away instantly. The Hyatt Place Niagara Falls is our hotel choice. The rooms are quite cheap during Covid season, and parking is located just across the street, only $10 per day with the hotel price. The Niagara Falls State Park and the Rainbow Bridge Toll Gate that connects Canada are all within the room view, about a 5-minute walking distance. A lot of the shops and restaurants are shut down during Covid, including the One Niagara Welcome Center, which houses many shops and food for a relatively cheaper price and within a very convenient distance. We had our “pre-dinner” walk around the tourist town. Not many visitors due to Covid and being on a weekday, which is both good and bad. I know there’s gonna be less wait for all the attractions and photo-taking. But the entire town just looks a little bit dilapidated. Our dinner is at the Rainforest Cafe, a restaurant chain with a unique indoor rainforest-themed decoration. The food was pretty normal and common with a slightly higher price (I guess because of the atmosphere). I think kids would really like dining in a place like this, but we have a pretty neutral feeling towards it. Day 2Being the only full day of our short trip, the focus for today is getting the best out of Niagara Falls, and we certainly did get a taste of it from all angles. There are a total of three falls in Niagara Falls. The Horseshoe Falls are the horseshoe-shaped falls (also known as the Canada Falls). It’s the most iconic and biggest falls, giving you a circular view when viewing on the Niagara River. There’s also the American Falls, located on the US side, just on the side of the State park, which is the most easy-to-access falls. The last and smallest one (about 1/6 of the width of the American Falls) is the Bridal Veil Falls located just past the American Falls (between Luna Island and Goat Island). It is the main view if you opt for the Cave of the Winds. Maid of The MistOur first stop is at the Maid of The Mist, a boat tour that takes you close to the foot of the Falls, our most anticipated activity. The touring season opens on Saturday, April 15, 2023, and runs until Sunday, November 5, 2023.More Info. You start by lining up outside the Observation tower and head down to the river level by elevator. The line wait only takes about 30 minutes (including getting the raincoat picked up and dressed), which is basically the duration of the boat tour. I enjoyed the boat ride very much; it is probably the best $30 I spent. Everyone headed to the upper deck, and you can move freely any time during the trip. We first arrived at the bottom of the American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls for about a couple of minutes, where you can really feel the chilling wind driven by the falling water. Then the boat starts to head to one of the biggest waterfalls in the world: the Horseshoe Falls, one of the seven wonders in the world. The water splashing and the wind blowing get bigger and bigger as we got closer. The boat turns around at about 100 feet away from the Falls: it is the optimal distance as getting closer, the mist would obscure the view entirely. I must say it is almost like standing in a rainstorm, but with rain being replaced by splashing mist. It is very hard to capture the view from my phone camera with all the boat turning and the wet condition. But I get to enjoy everything from my eyes; this is one of those things that you have to experience in person. I’m completely stunned and moved by the raw power and sheer magnitude of the cascading river that is created by nature. Helicopter RideThe boat ride set an excellent mood for us in the morning, and we took a few pictures in the state park and bought a few souvenirs before heading to lunch. After a short nap, we went for the more expensive and private experience to enjoy the Niagara Falls from the best angle: from the sky. Rainbow Helicopter Tour runs just from the hotel regions, and the ticket is around $120 per person, but it’s a fixed $110 if you pay by cash, so that’s $10 plus tax (about $20) savings. There is a short line because only one helicopter is operating at a time on a first-come-first-serve basis. Each party waits around 10 minutes, 2 minutes to get onboard, and 8 minutes worth of the tour. The crew is quite friendly, offered us earplugs, and took a group photo before boarding. This is my first time riding a helicopter, and it is surprisingly fast how it takes off. My mind is completely occupied with looking at the views below, and I didn’t even have time to process sitting on a small vehicle hovering thousands of feet above the ground. Only when seeing from above did I understand the overall structure and scale of the Niagara Falls, and had a thorough glance at the Niagara river’s flow. It is a memorable but short experience. I would personally recommend it, but I admit the price is pretty steep. Goat IslandSince the helicopter ride was pretty short, we still had a few hours before the night got dark. We took an hour to walk along the Goat Island by crossing a bridge that crosses the American Falls. On the Goat island, you can observe the Falls fairly close-up, and from the surface level. When I look down as the water drops hundreds of feet below, I can’t help feeling a chill through my spine imagining what it would be like if I fell into the current. Anyways, Goat island is also a quite convenient location to visit and take pictures. Later, the Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls USA also became a pretty good option to kill our time. Right after that, we headed to a nearby Thai food restaurant for dinner: the Mandalay Restaurant &amp; Bar. It serves one of the best pineapple fried rice and pork belly curry, and the price is also super cheap, so I highly recommend this restaurant. Light showAfter dinner, we had a stroll in the State Park again to enjoy the light show of the Niagara Falls that happens every evening. I know there are certain times in the year when there’s a holiday firework, but it is a rare occasion, and we didn’t plan for it. However, the light show is still pretty. Day 3We left Niagara Falls on the morning of Day 3, but we were planning to visit the Cave of the Winds. Unfortunately, our plan had to change due to more visitors coming during the weekends, and we didn’t want to go back home too late. I think we agreed we’ve seen plenty of the gorgeous Niagara Falls, but if we have more time, I would definitely pay it a visit, and also head to the Observation point for viewing Horseshoe Falls on the USA side. Other AttractionsIf you have more time here are some of the other attractions I think worth visiting: If you have more time, here are some other attractions worth visiting: Cave of the Winds: A natural cave behind Bridal Veil Falls at the Niagara Falls. You get to venture down wooden walkways and stand only feet away from the crashing water of the Bridal Veil Falls. A raincoat is necessary to avoid being completely soaked (even from the smallest of the three falls). Whirlpool Jet Boat Tours: A great option if you want to get some thrill, with dry or soaked options available, just a 10-minute drive from the Niagara Falls, downstream of the Niagara River. Niagara Zipper: Niagara Falls is not only about the water; try ziplining across the Erie Canal basin gorge, 85 feet above, at speeds up to 40 mph, crossing over the historic waters of the Erie Canal and back!

It took place about four years ago at the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I believe today’s cost would be closer to $1,500 to $1,800. This getaway occurred during spring break, providing me some well-deserved vacation time. It was also the time when COVID-19 cases were emerging across different states in the nation. Fortunately, there were zero cases in Florida when we booked the trip and returned. Day 1Booking a flight to Fort Lauderdale is significantly cheaper ($100) than booking a direct flight to Miami ($400+). Fort Lauderdale is only 20 miles away from downtown Miami. Upon arriving in Fort Lauderdale, I was welcomed by much warmer weather than the northeastern region during late winter, with temperatures hovering around 27 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit). We started our adventure with a leisurely stroll at West Lake Park and continued along the coast all the way to the renowned GG’s Waterfront. Florida’s stone crab is a culinary delight, and it is, by far, the most delicious and freshest seafood I’ve ever savored. Its flavor is incredibly natural and unprocessed/raw (probably why it’s unique to the state of Florida). I relished this culinary delight while gazing at the gorgeous ocean views. When ordering stone crab claws, opt for the medium size instead of large or jumbo size. A medium-sized claw comes in a set of six for about $40, whereas jumbo claws can set you back around $90 for just three pieces. The size difference between medium and jumbo is only about 30%, making the medium size a much better value. We took a ride-share service to Miami, which took about 40-50 minutes for a 12-mile journey (as there are no highway). The hotel was quite nice, and while there were numerous hotels in the region, dining options were limited unless you were willing to walk for about 15 minutes. This is why, on our first night, we settled for a nearby dining establishment serving simple dishes. Day 2Our second day began with a visit to the beach, marking my first time experiencing a Southern United States beach and witnessing the vast North Atlantic Ocean. The weather was just right: neither hot nor cold, perfect for a leisurely walk on the beach, although not warm enough to take a dip in the ocean (goodbye, swimsuit plans). Following a brief stop at the beach, we headed to Lincoln Road near the City Center district. The street exuded a unique and lively atmosphere, offering fantastic shopping and dining opportunities to soak in the local culture. Noon had arrived, and we decided on a Hispanic meal featuring seafood paella and a lobster feast. Afterward, we returned to the hotel for a well-deserved rest. In the afternoon, we explored another Miami beach, located in the south. It featured a boardwalk along the coastline similar to the one in Santa Monica, Los Angeles. During our visit, there was a winter party festival for the LGBTQ community, with many people congregating near the park. Later in a report it was said that led to 38 people contracting COVID-19 and resulted in two deaths. As the afternoon progressed, the wind picked up, and a few raindrops fell. Upon reaching the southernmost corner, we indulged in a lobster roll at a small shop. Within a five-minute walk, we discovered the famous Joe’s Stone Crab restaurant (arguably the most renowned Stone Crab establishment in Miami). Due to the crowd, we opted for a Stone crab takeout and their renowned fried chicken. To save money and still savor a satisfying meal, order the fried chicken with Stone crab. A half chicken costs only $9.9. Choose takeout, as the restaurant is often packed. Day 3Prior on visiting Miami, I’ve booked a one-day guided tour to the Everglades through TripAdvisor, as Florida is renowned for its unique swamplands. The tour was a round-trip from Miami downtown to The Everglades Holiday Park, and it turned out to be an excellent deal. For less than $100, we got the round-trip transportation, a thrilling half-hour airboat tour across the Everglades, a complimentary photo, and admission to the exciting gator show. The airboat tour was incredibly relaxed, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the mesmerizing Florida swamp. We encountered wild birds and, of course, some gators along the way. The gators, though not too active, were fascinating to observe as they remained still with their heads partially exposed. During the 30-45 minute tour, we spotted a couple of these incredible creatures. It’s worth mentioning that it can get quite chilly when the airboat hits full speed, approximately 40 mph, and the noise from the turbine can be deafening. So, don’t forget to bring a jacket! Immediately after the airboat tour, we were treated to a gator show featuring some daring and impressive performances. Our host was none other than Chris from the Gator Boys, a famous internet celebrity on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Lunchtime arrived, and we headed to the restaurant and souvenir shop conveniently located on the premises. What did we decide to try? Fried gator meat! It had a unique taste, somewhat resembling dry fried chicken meat. In the evening, we dined at a charming restaurant called Fifi’s on the Beach Seafood. It turned out to be the culinary highlight of our Miami trip, offering delectable options like lobster and prawns, all of which tasted simply amazing! Day 4With just half a day left in Miami before our departure, our final destination was the lively Bayside Market and Bayside Park, where we were greeted by the sight of numerous sports cars cruising around. Bayside Market offered a delightful array of restaurants, sweet treats, and charming local shops, making it the perfect place for some last-minute gift shopping. Later, we ventured to a renowned award-winning Peruvian restaurant, CVI.CHE 105, particularly known for its ceviche. However, my review of the experience is rather disappointing. Not only were the dishes overpriced, but the quality felt rushed, as the meats appeared hastily cooked and blended together. And so, our memorable trip came to a close. The return ride-share to Fort Lauderdale Airport in the afternoon took a bit longer than expected, roughly around an hour, so be sure to plan accordingly. Your support keeps our adventures alive.

The beautiful lakeside city of Michigan City is only a 1.5-hour drive away from Purdue University in West Lafayette, home of the Boilermakers. For someone like me living in the east of the nation, it is the closest I can get for a costal ocean and beach experience, and for almost no costs! Which is why throughout the years I spent living in the northern east, I’ve visited Michigan city three times. Indiana Dunes State ParkImportant: Don’t get mixed with “Indiana Dunes National Park”, which will get discussed at the very end. Let’s get straight to the point, look at those beaches and water, there’s no distinction between this great lake and the actual ocean visually. The swimming beach is located inside the Indiana Dunes State Park, spreading over 2000 acres. What’s more, the state park also offers over 16 miles of hiking trails. So, you can go for a short hike and then dive in and cool down at the gorgeous Michigan great lake. The entry fee is only $7 per vehicle for Indiana residents and $12 per vehicle for non-residents. Like all other state parks, there are certain days when the entry fees are free. Other StopsShoreline Brewery &amp; Restaurant If you need to grab a bite, I strongly recommend this place as I’ve happened to visit them twice, and both experience were fantastic. They have excellent crafted beers and also amazing fish and chips. The restaurant is also super close to the premium outlets and also the lighthouse next to the lake coast. Michigan Pierhead Lighthouse This landmark stands proudly at the edge of Lake Michigan.The beach next to the lighthouse has hard sand compared to the state park. However, the advantage is that it offers a pretty spectacular view and, the best part, you can enjoy this stunning vista without spending a dime. Lighthouse Place Premium Outlets The Lighthouse Premium Outlets are also a point of interest, with ample parking space and a wide variety of dining options. As you shop, you can enjoy the open-air experience and breathe in the fresh lakeside air. Indiana Dunes National Park (Optional) The Indian Dunes National Park is located on the both sides of the State Park, it is perfect for camping if you need plans for multiple days. The entry fee is $25 per vehicle for a 7-day pass. Your support keeps our adventures alive.

I was kind of skeptical about how the trip would turn out, as I’m very afraid of cold weather (Chicago this time of year is already hovering around zero degrees Celsius). However, the trip turned out to be surprisingly pleasant and bang for your buck. Day 1The drive was pretty smooth until we approached the downtown area. Fortunately, it was in the morning to noon, so the traffic was slow but still moving along. We arrived at our hotel, FieldHouse Jones (now The Chicago Hotel Collection River North). We parked just across the street from the hotel under a metro bridge. Parking was $30 a night with the hotel discount. Given the availability of public transportation and the difficulty of finding parking, we decided to leave the vehicle there for the entire trip. The hotel is a really nice establishment with a very unique American old-fashioned urban decor. The three of us shared a room, and with the surprisingly cheap average hotel price in a big city like Chicago and splitting the cost, I ended up only paying around $40 per night. Magnificent MileThe Magnificent Mile is within walking distance (15 minutes) from our hotel, one of the reasons we chose it. It’s the most popular and premium shopping district in Chicago, spanning over 13 blocks filled with luxury stores and skyscrapers, perfect for shopping. Today happened to be the Lights Festival Parade (which occurs on Saturday just before Thanksgiving every year), and people packed both sidewalks. It was a joy to squeeze through the crowds and merchants with a holiday season vibe. If you got tired watching the parade, you could easily head inside a random store to warm up (seriously, it was freezing outside). We didn’t spend too much time there because we had plenty of other sites to visit in the downtown region, plus we needed to grab a bite. Cloud Gate and Ice Stake RinkHeading to the far south end of the Magnificent Mile, just half a mile over the DuSable Bridge, we arrived at Millennium Park (also a metro stop). The park boasts the iconic and must-visit Cloud Gate. Cloud Gate is a modern, giant sculpture that looks like a bean. The sculpture has a reflective surface that captures the surrounding skyscrapers and your reflection. Just underneath the Cloud Gate platform is the McCormick Ice Skating Rink, and it was the perfect time for ice skating, costing just $20. Batman: The Dark Knight locationsAfter a 10-minute walk, we arrived at the famous German Berghoff Restaurant, established over 100 years ago. Chicago’s downtown was one of the shooting spots for Christopher Nolan’s Batman series, and the Berghoff Restaurant was featured as one of the movie spots for mobsters gathering in Batman: The Dark Knight. While in the downtown region, we visited other shooting locations as well. If you’re a Batman: The Dark Knight fan like us and want to visit all the movie locations in Chicago, this map is perfect for you. Day 2Our Day 2 began with a revisit to the Magnificent Mile because our rush visit last night wasn’t enough. Right after that, we took the metro to the south side of Chicago: Chinatown, where we had our lunch. SkyDeck ChicagoDo you want to know the perfect time to capture the view of Chicago from high above? It’s 4:00 PM in standard time (winter time) because within the hour, you get to see the sunset, experiencing both day and night views of Chicago. The wait to get up to the SkyDeck wasn’t too bad, about a 30-minute wait on weekends before a major holiday. I’d say it’s totally not worth spending twice the amount on admission to get the fast pass, as it may only save you 15 minutes since both lines eventually merge. There’s a transparent glass platform/floor in the SkyDeck where you can step onto and ask your friend to take a picture for a perfect unblocked view of you and Chicago. There’s a line for it, and each participation is timed. Day 3The Lincoln Park Zoo is a 35-acre zoo located in Lincoln Park, founded in 1868, making it one of the oldest zoos in the nation. The best thing, in my opinion, is that admission is completely free. I admit that this season might not be the best time to visit the zoo, as some of the outdoor animals are in hibernation, and it can be quite windy strolling inside the park. However, there are plenty of indoor animal exhibitions, and you won’t need to fight the crowds. The ZooLights event also starts around this time, and admission is less than $10, depending on which day you choose to visit. After visiting the zoo, Lincoln Park is a good place to stroll, located at the south end of the zoo. Taking a casual walk through the lakes, trees, and the Lincoln monument is quite relaxing. The Lincoln Park Conservatory botanic garden is located on the opposite side (north of the zoo). We had a bit to eat at a small but delicious Thai restaurant near the zoo and walked back to the hotel, experiencing the Old Town of Chicago with a 1.5-mile walk while sharing talks and laughs.

Situated right between two major Missouri cities, Kansas City and St. Louis, Columbia is a hidden gem that I recommend to anyone traveling through I-70; Stroll at MizzouThe centerpiece of our visit is the campus tour of the University of Missouri - Columbia (Mizzou). I advise setting aside at least 2 hours to explore the main part of the campus. Some must-see spots, in my opinion, include the iconic six columns (alongside Jesse Hall in the same plaza), the Memorial Union, Ellis Library, the Tiger fountain and the Student Center (with the Rec Center conveniently just across the street). For your ease, I’ve outlined an optimal walking route to cover all these interesting points efficiently as I’ve been tour guiding friends and families multiple times. (Route start at Lee Hills Hall) Exploring Campus BuildingsMany of the campus buildings are open to the public. Don’t miss out on visiting the Engineering Building (which was newly built), Jesse Hall, Ellis Library, Memorial Union, and the Student Center. The campus bookstore is also in the Student Center if you wish to purchase Mizzou souvenirs. Mizzou Rec’s Guest ServicesIf you happen to know someone studying in Mizzou, I highly recommend visiting the Mizzou Rec for a reasonable fee of $12 (including tax). In addition to the gym facilities, they offer a spa for some relaxation. Did I mention, it was once voted as top 3 best recreational center in the nation. Learn more here: Mizzou Rec Guest Services Downtown DelightsColumbia’s downtown area offers a range of delightful options. I often go to the boba shop: Bubblecup Tea Zone, Thai restaurants (Thai Express and Bangkok Gardens are my top picks), and much more to satisfy any taste buds for lunch or dinner after the campus tour The Big Burr OakColumbia’s hidden gem, in my opinion, is the Big burr oak tree. It’s definitely worth a short 10-mile trip, taking less than 20 minutes to drive. The journey is peaceful and the destination is Instagram-worthy shot of a huge Oak tree with the perfect tree crown. Other StopsStephens Lake Park:If you’re looking for a place to unwind after your tour or road trip, I recommend Stephens Lake Park. Although not vast, it features a charming small lake with walking bridges (often bustling with people fishing). It’s a picnic-friendly spot and even welcomes your furry friends. Capen Park:Capen Park is perfect for you if you’d like to get some outdoor trail walking going where you can experience some small elevation with beautiful cliffs. It’s only 5 minutes drive away from Mizzou Campus. The Grindstone Creek (which you’ll be able to overlook) is also accessible on foot. Columbia Mall:For some generic retail stores beyond the downtown area, a visit to the Columbia Mall is a good choice. Jefferson City:The Capital of Missouri, Jefferson City is about a 50 minutes drive from Columbia towards the south, so it’s not in the same direction between Kansas City and St Louis.There’s a pretty good Sushi place called love sushi, they are in good value (the sexy lady and sexy guy are brought with fire lit). Other than the State Capitol Hall and the Missouri State Museum there’s not much to visit. Your support keeps our adventures alive.
